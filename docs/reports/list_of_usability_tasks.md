## User Group: Volunteer

You are a 64 years old, retired bus driver that is not very familiar with technology and has only used a smartphone for making calls and texting. To pass time, you have decided to volunteer for ABC Farms, a local farm, which focuses on growing fresh produce such as apples, plums, and squashes. This is your first time working with them and have never heard of the Food Saviour website until now. You have been tasked to calculate how much food waste the organization has diverted from the landfill and use those results to create a report. 

### Tasks:

1. Create an account.
2. View your profile.
3. Log out of your account.
4. Log into your account.
5. Enter data to figure out how much food waste the organization has diverted from the landfill so far.
6. Export your results.
7. Add some more data entries.
8. Download your results again.
9. Delete one or more data entries.

### Questionnaire: 

- Would you prefer to have options to choose what type of graph the data is plotted on? 
- How is the readability of the website? 
- Did you find the registration process a smooth one, free of any ambiguities?
- If you enter the wrong information in one of the inputs (description/amount) an error is displayed, is this error indicative of what you need to do next?
- Were there any difficult tasks? If there was, is there a feature you wish the website had to help with that?
