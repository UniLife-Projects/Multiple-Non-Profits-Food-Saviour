In the teamwork agreement, we commit to:

- Be respectful to other team members
- Do not interrupt others when speaking
- Be punctual to meetings
- Alert other members when an issue/concern arises
- Update team members on work progress
- Tell members in advance if you will be absent
- Keep in contact with team members even when absent
- Set soft deadlines and hard deadlines for each task
  - Soft deadline: 48hrs before the assignment deadline
  - Hard deadline for review: 24hrs before assignment deadline
  - Time left (<24hrs) is designated for making corrections and improvements after review
- Record meeting minutes for every meeting (client, professor/TA, team)

When there are conflicting opinions, we will resolve them by:

- Address concerns in a calm, timely manner
- Listen to all opinions with an open-mind
- Discuss between all team members
- Weigh the advantages and disadvantageous (if applicable)
- Reach a consensus
- If the situation escalates, a third-party will be consulted to mediate
