# Food Saviour Research

There is no doubt that the issue of food waste is a global dilemma. Moreover, many people are unaware and blind to the effect food waste has on the world. The greenhouse gases emitted when the food is thrown into the landfill and the lack of awareness of the fuel and resources that went into producing the food are two things that everyone should be aware of.

From the intense research that we have conducted as a group, we believe that it would be beneficial for us to create a dashboard that allows users to enter the different types of products they are throwing away, the system will then display back different graphs comparing their waste with different how much their food waste is worth, how much greenhouse is emitted and many more. People tend to be more understanding of the food waste issue if we illustrate to them how much food they are wasting in comparison with different metrics such as money, water, and greenhouse gases emitted as a result of their food waste.

Cost:
1) Determine the total food wasted (kg)
2) Determine the total food you initially had (kg)
3) food wasted / food produced * 100
4) decimal of the % yielded times the initial cost
