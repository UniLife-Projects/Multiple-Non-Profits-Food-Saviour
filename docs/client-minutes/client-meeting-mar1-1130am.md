# Client Meeting March 01 2023 1130 am

## Follow-Ups from Last Week

- How long the tokens last

## Attendees

- Maysey Lu
- Harman Sahota
- Abdulaziz Almutlaq
- Onwuvuche Jordan C

## To Do

- Post it in Git Discussions about the choice between renewable vs non-renewable tokens
- Ensure the graphics of the tracker are good
  - The font size
  - The graph colors should be those that color blind people can see
  - The percentages should show, possibly as a hover function, but main point is they show

## Minutes

- Implement token.
- renewable vs nonrenewable: consider this will the token be renewable or will a new one be issued.
- the timeline is important (30 min to 1 hr)- This has been figured out by Harman.
- Communicate the token choice on GitHub discussion
- consider action-> timeout, log out etc.
- Implementation of graphing is not yet done--> pace needs to be picked up
  -pie charts
- The graph's design is important and should be carefully considered. Ease of interpretation should be a priority
  -consider choosing an ideal font and size.
  - it needs to be readable and easy to interpret.
  - test the font for yourself and ensure that it is easy to read
    - include %'s in the graph.
- look into the graphing of the sharing page and how it will be implemented. How data will be illustrated.

- Discussion board is good- implement the TA's changes and it will be good to go.

## Summary

- In summary, there are several tasks that need to be completed to improve a web application. These tasks include implementing a token for authentication and deciding whether it will be renewable or nonrenewable ensuring that the project timeline is met, communicating the token choice on the GitHub discussion board, and considering actions such as timeout and logout to protect user data. Additionally, there is a need to focus on the implementation of graphing, particularly using pie charts, and ensuring that the design is easy to interpret and includes percentages. Lastly, it is necessary to look into how data will be illustrated on the sharing page and implement any changes recommended by the TA to the discussion board.

## Questions

> **Would we be renewing the token or making it a new one?**
> We will figure that out when we get there.

> **How are we doing with the graphics?**
>
> - We're doing alright so far, figured out the calculations, we should have figured the front end back end data transfer and the graphics display by the end of the week

> **What's the progress with the sharing page?**
>
> - The pie chart will be better to use compared to the line chart - Barbs
> - The graphics have to be linked to the tracker page
> - The graphics have to be labelled with manager's names
