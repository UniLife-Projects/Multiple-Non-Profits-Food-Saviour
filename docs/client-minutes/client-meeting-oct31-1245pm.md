# Client Meeting 31st October 2022

## Key Points

- Building a website for organizations to use to track how much food they are saving
- Website will have a tracker page where the user can input the amount (in weight) of food (fresh produce, frozen produce, meat, etc.) they have saved and the website will generate a graphic to visualize that data
- There should be a discussion blog where organizations can post to let other organizations know if they have leftover food that they need to give away or request leftover food from other organizations
- Within an organization, there is a hierarchy of roles (i.e. manager, volunteer, etc.) which have different levels of access to different website functions
- Generally, organizations will enter this data bi-annually but you should give them the flexibility
- There should be functionality for the user to export a PDF, CSV, etc. because they will use this record for when they report back to the government/apply for government grants
- Landing page should have a section with all the organizations (that have consented) listed and categorized by what they do (?)
- We will need to do some research to find some of these public datasets
- We are using the same tech stack
