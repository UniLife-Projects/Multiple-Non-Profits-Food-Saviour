###### Sharing page

- [ ] Make a graphing for the sharing page
- Display a list of users in the current organization and what they have shared with the organization.
- Display each user's role and the name of the organization they belong to.
- Only display the users that have shared something with the current organization
- Volunteers are not allowed to share content as they do not have approval to do so.
- Before sharing anything, users must select who they want to share with, such as non-profits, community gardens, food banks, and other partners. This step should come first in the sharing process. Users should also select their own role (e.g. farmer, partner).

###### Profile page

- [ ] Add a new role in the 'Profile' page.

## Decisions

- Project timeline constrained to August due to availability.


## Summary
- On February 15, 2023 at 11:30am, a client meeting took place. The follow-ups from the previous week included progress on the React conversion and API integration. The agenda for the meeting was to discuss the tracking page and the sharing page. The meeting resulted in several to-do items for the tracker page, such as making a pie chart and allowing users to select different chart types, along with category options. For the sharing page, a list of users in the current organization was discussed, along with user roles, and the requirement to select who to share with and the user's own role. The decision was made to constrain the project timeline to August due to availability. Additionally, there was a discussion of adding a new role in the profile page.
