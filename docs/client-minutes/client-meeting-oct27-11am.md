## Minutes

- Client, some design aspects cannot be changed are extremely important for the users. Such as the navigation bars. We have to include what is on the screenshot that the client provided as it is important to the design. 
- There has to be a visual that shows the user where they are currently at on the website. This makes it easier for the user to navigate
- Change the lines to boxes, it is the preference of the client as she believes that it will be easier for the website users to input information
- There doesnâ€™t need to be categories on the trackers page. Moreover, the trackers does not have to be filled every week
- Build the interfaces nearly identical to the screenshots as they serve their purpose. The client has things that she believes would work.
- To do list needs to be on the left side. The first thing on the page.
- Replace the to-do list and my goals
- Professional feedbacks should not be on the individual graphs page
- Selective graphs have feedback
- No hovers and less clicking on the pages because our target audience do not understand their functionality
- TA are mostly retired people. Therefore, over crowd the navigation bar with all the words. So no hover.
- Graphs needs labels. This would make it easier for the challenge participants to interpret the graph.
