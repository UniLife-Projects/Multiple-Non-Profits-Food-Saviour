- We will need to consult experts in the development of applications for things such as
- Funding of different parties such as doctors, technologies, is ridiculously costly.
- Barbara is leading towards MySQL and Django - for both frontend and backend.
- We will be transferring to the UBC infrastructure in case the Compute Canada service goes down due to insufficient funding and redundant technology.
  - Wade Klaver will take care of that.
- Could import different kinds of datasets using WorkBench or with Python.

> _Ignore since she'll give us walkthrough demo_

- Trying to polish up to 5 trackers with a consultant.
- Scrolling is important.

- Under Individual Graphs, there are graphs that visualize health trackers with captions displaying current progress and target.
- Under Professional view, there's visual charts displaying progress. _There's also a box to put the SQL there - apparently for something to do with "consent"_
- In TA dashboard, there's a "Who's responsible" box, a "My TA Hours" Graph, and a "Entire TA Hours" Graph.
- We might have a box that points to the repository (whichever location they want) for document upload.
