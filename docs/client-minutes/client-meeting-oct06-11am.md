### MINUTES

- Have to communicate to the professor through the repository.
- Don't mess with the server cause repairing it is going to be a problem to repair as Wade (support) is extremely busy.
- SSH Keys are necessary to authenticate someone into the development
- Barbara and Wade (IT-Support) looking at possibility of separating / partitioning different virtual machines. This is because there are not enough virtual machines for everyone.
- Gema wants Barbara to have us working on different **"technical"** versions of the project.
- She spoke about something to do with using Joomla with Django.
- FastAPI is not directly workable with HTML.
- It might be better to use FastAPI as Django might be too heavy for the pages we're releasing early in the project.
  - Django contains too many layers.
- Barbara says we might use Git Issues preferrably to Asana and Trello (since it's central to everyone).
- We should place the research information we get in Barbara's repo to make it group-wide information.
- Gema will take us through the SQL Filter techniques.
- Should have a page for homeless people from where we can access the contact info of the people that are providing the services on ground.
- We have to tell Barbara what to do, say we need her to accept a pull request, we have to explicitly tell her how to do it, cause she might not know how.
- We don't have accounts on the website because we have to wait for her to work with some other student and make things stable first.
- Barbara wants us to return more inquisitive from her about the website, it's front-end features after designing the mockups.
- Barbara recommends we edit files on GitHub when we need to update something.
- By dashboards, we mean web pages.

### QUESTION ANSWERS


### Summary

- Communicate with the professor through the repository and avoid interfering with the server. Use SSH keys for authentication and collaborate with IT support on virtual machine partitioning. Consider using Joomla with Django or FastAPI as alternatives for the project. Utilize Git Issues for project management and share research information in the group-wide repository. Learn SQL filter techniques and create a page for homeless people to access service provider contacts. Provide explicit instructions for Barbara, as needed. Wait for website account creation and return with inquiries about front-end features after designing mockups. Edit files on GitHub for updates, and remember that dashboards refer to web pages.
