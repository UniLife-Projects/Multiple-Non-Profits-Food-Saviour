# Team Meeting Minutes - Nov. 25th, 2022

**Important:**

According to the TA, **everyone** is expected to be present at the peer testing sessions on Wednesday, Nov. 29th and Friday, Dec. 2nd at 9:20AM PST. 

> I'm not too sure how it will work with you being online, so please make sure to contact the TA regarding how that will work for you. 

**Reminder:**

Make note of the changes that Barb requested from us at yesterday's meeting. However, we do **not** need to adhere to these changes right away for the client meeting next week. Just make note of the changes and keep them in mind while you continue to improve your sections for the peer testing rather than changing it now and potentially having it not function. 

## For this coming week:

- Continue on working on your assigned tasks in preparation for the peer testing next week
- If you finish your tasks early, please lend a hand to the other team members
- Please do not leave your tasks until last minute, we don't want to come across any issues when we begin the peer testing
- If you think you won't finish your tasks in time, LET SOMEONE KNOW

## Progress update:

- The tracker page is able to take data input from the user and save it into the database
    - The graphing part is still a work in progress. First chart to complete is the pie chart, and then we can look into other charting options for the user to choose from
    - Barb would like to add another column to the data entry form and have one form for each category on the page, rather than having a dropdown menu for them to select
- The admin page is able to save the data permissions for each role and approve or decline any pending accounts and display them in their respective tables
- The profile page is close to functioning the way it should (by knowing who is logged in and display their account details), this will hopefully be resolved by Monday.
- The network page is still a work in progress. We need one person to finish up the frontend and then the backend can be started.

As mentioned previously, please keep in contact with your partner for each page to ensure that all features are completed by the deadline.

The list of usability tasks is due **TONIGHT**. Maysey has done the first half, so please make sure to complete the second half before 10PM for a final review.

### Notes: 

The prototype video that was supposed to be due this week is now due on Wednesday before the peer testing session. Please make sure to finish your tasks and have the features functioning in time for the recording.
