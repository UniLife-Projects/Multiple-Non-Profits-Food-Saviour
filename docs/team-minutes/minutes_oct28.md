To do for today and this coming week:
  - Upload the Figma designs onto the design review [document](docs/research/mockup_review.md)
  - Make comments where the client wanted changes
  - Begin coding the skeleton layout of some of the pages:
    - Maysey: Homepage
    - Harman: Registration
    - Jordan: Login
    - Aziz: Tracker

  - Refine the Figma designs to meet what the client wanted/suggested

#### Notes:
- Gema will attend the next client meeting with us to make sure the client is aware of what is required of the students for the course
- As of right now, we will keep to what the client requires us to do, even if that is limiting our creativity
