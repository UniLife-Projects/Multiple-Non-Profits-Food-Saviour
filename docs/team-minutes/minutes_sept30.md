6. Discuss the problems we've been facing up till now and discuss some potential solutions.

    - It has not been a problem yet, but it is anticipated in the future that we'll need quick responses from team members.
        - To prepare for this, we need everyone's phone number saved.
    - Merge conflicts due to `.DS_Store`
        - As suggested by Maysey, Harman will look into creating a `.gitignore` file

7. Discuss about the gitstats report we have to submit today.
    - Current gitstats report show:

      |user|score|
      |----|-----|
      |AbdulazizAlmutlaq0| 108.40
      |Harman Sahota     |121.22
      |Maysey Lu         |103.23
      |Uchej-coder       |121.82

      Everyone's gitstats score looks good. Maysey's score should increase slightly after she uploads the team meeting minutes and IP agreement.

8. What we have to discuss with Barb next meeting.
    - Nothing new to discuss at the moment.
