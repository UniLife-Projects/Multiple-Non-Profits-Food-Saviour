Meeting Agenda:

1. Fix a specific day and time for each week where we have the team meeting to discuss stuff so we have a meeting with the team and the client every week.

- If client meetings are every Thursday at 11am in EME 4134, team meetings should be held Friday evenings (one day after client meeting) to recap what was discussed at the meeting, what needs to be done by the next client meeting, and assign tasks to each team member. These team meetings do not need to be in-person, they can be held through Discord voice call.

2. How can we divide the tasks from the meeting as per our roles (client liaison, project managaer, tech leader, QA leader)?

- *Client liaison* will be responsible for recording client meeting minutes, communicating with the client and between the team and client, and undestanding/defining the client's expectations.
- *Project manager* will be responsible for recording team meeting minutes and ensuring all team members are on the same page and understand what their assigned tasks and deadlines are.
- *Technical lead* will be responsible for organizing the Github repository and helping team members with technical issues or issues with coding/ unit testing.
- *Quality assurance lead* will be responsible for ensuring the project meets quality standards by finding areas that need improvement.

- When there are tasks that are not specific to each role, the tasks will be divided between the team members as equally as possible. If there is unequal task division (i.e. more role-specific tasks), then team members can discuss to distribute role-specific tasks to even out the workload.

3. Discuss tasks from previous meeting

- Harman has created issues on the Github repository, please check to see which tasks are assigned to you.

4. Discuss the problems we've been facing up until now and discuss some potential solutions

- This week we had issues with communications between team members and with the client,  causing disorganization.
- After discussion, we decided we needed to improve our communication. To do this, client liaison will inform the team members of all emails received by the client by forwarding the email to the team members or sending a screenshot in the group Discord server. In addition, weekly team meetings will be held a day after the client meeting to ensure everyone knows what to do for the week. It is also expected that all team members are active in the Discord server and respond to messages in a timely matter.
- A soft deadline and hard deadline have been set to ensure that the team does not follow behind. The soft deadline is **TWO** days before the assignment deadline and the hard deadline is **ONE** day before the assignment deadline. All team members are expected to complete their tasks by the soft deadline so that the project manager can do an overall review for mistakes or improvements before submission. If there are things to fix, these must be completed by the hard deadline.

5. Discuss about the gitstats report we have to submit this Friday and stuff we have to discuss with Barb next meeting

- Currently, the gitstats show varying scores between members, with some scores lower than 50%. This should improve once all team members have completed their assigned tasks for this week (*note*: the user stories are not due this week, but due next week).
- The client liaison must prepare a list of questions that will be asked at tomorrow's meeting with the client.
- An IP agreement must be signed by the client and the team and submitted to Canvas by this Friday.
